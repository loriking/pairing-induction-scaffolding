# Pairing Induction Scaffoldings

This repository contains scaffoldings for the Pairing Induction for different
languages, currently supported:

 - [Java](java/README.md)
 - [Javascript](javascript/README.md)
 - [Kotlin](kotlin/README.md)
 - [Scala](scala/README.md)


 The projects are very simple and contain all the necessary setup to be able
 to start writing code and tests and be able to run the tests.

 In each of the projects there are instructions in the `README` to install the
 required environments and to execute the tests.

Optionally you can have `GIT` installed to clone the repository and have the code ready for the session, but if you couldn't or had troubles with it, you can always download the source code as a `ZIP` file from GitHub.

To install GIT with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install git
```

To clone the repository:

```bash
cd <any folder of your choice>
git clone https://github.com/saljuama/pairing-induction-scaffolding.git
```

This will create the `pairing-induction-scaffolding` folder in your computer.
After that you can `cd` into your language of choice, follow the instructions on the language specific `README.md` and ... Happy Hacking!
