#Pairing Induction Exercise

There are several dependency management and build tools available for Typescript, we provide instructions for the following options:
- NPM
- Yarn

Both package managers can coexist peacefully, so not a big deal choosing one or the other, some of the differences are:
- NPM is the official tool
- Yarn provides some extra features (such as offline mode and license checking)
- Both use the same registry to manage dependencies
- Both have similar CLI syntax
