# Pairing Induction Exercise

## Requirements

In order to be able to work with the exercise, you need to install `node` and
either `npm` or `yarn`. Using homebrew:

If you prefer *NPM*, this command will install both `node` and `npm`
(don't need to install `yarn`):

```bash
brew install node
```

If you prefer *YARN*, then use this command instead (this will also install
`node`):

```bash
brew install yarn
```

## Quick Start

First bring all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

Tests can be executed in the terminal, from the root folder of the project:

```bash
npm run test
```

or

```bash
yarn test
```

or

Using the IDE
