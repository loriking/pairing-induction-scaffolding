# Javascript with Yarn

## Quick Start

* Import the dependencies

_NOTE_: You need to do this only once when cloning the project, and maybe again when dependencies are added or removed from the project:

```bash
yarn install
```

* Tests can be executed in the terminal, from the root folder of the project:

```bash
yarn test
```

or

Using the IDE


## Requirements

In order to be able to work with the exercise, you need to install `node` and `yarn`, using homebrew, this command instead will install both ( FYI: and also `npm` ):

```bash
brew install yarn
```
